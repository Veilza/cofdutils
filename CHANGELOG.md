#### 0.1.5
* Updated the Beats Menu display, now displaying Beats/XP and updating when the actors on the list update!
* A bunch of code restructuring/fixes and cleaned up the way I get the actor sheets.
* Changed a bunch of lets to consts because some variables were never changed.
* Fix for how the Combat Selector displayed the dice mods.

#### 0.1.4
* Quick fix for applying automated defense to the weapon's dicepool.

#### 0.1.3
* Added a new module: Combat Selector, which will automatically subtract a selected token's defense to a weapon's roll when the dialogue is brought up.

#### 0.1.2
* Localization added! Now all the pieces of the menu pull from the language file, which can be expanded later to include other languages.

#### 0.1.1
* Reworked some functions and cleaned various bits of code up, plus tweaked setting names for futureproofing.

#### 0.1.0
* Initial commit! Group Beats menu is there, and working, but localization isn't and things still need to be cleaned up.
