## Chronicles of Darkness Utilities
Utilities and add-ons for the [Chronicles of Darkness 2e](https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta) system.

### Developer Notes
If you'd like to follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThalissaRemnant), I retweet mostly tabletop stuff and cool art over there and will occasionally post updates about things I'm working on. Additionally I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thalissa) if you'd like to support me!

### Contributors
Those that assist in contributing to the project will be listed here! Though I expect no help, if anyone provides any assistance I'll be more than happy to pull code in.

### Changelog
#### 0.1.2
* Localization added! Now all the pieces of the menu pull from the language file, which can be expanded later to include other languages.

#### 0.1.1
* Reworked some functions and cleaned various bits of code up, plus tweaked setting names for futureproofing.

#### 0.1.0
* Initial commit! Group Beats menu is there, and working, but localization isn't and things still need to be cleaned up.
