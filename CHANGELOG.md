#### 0.1.2
* Localization added! Now all the pieces of the menu pull from the language file, which can be expanded later to include other languages.

#### 0.1.1
* Reworked some functions and cleaned various bits of code up, plus tweaked setting names for futureproofing.

#### 0.1.0
* Initial commit! Group Beats menu is there, and working, but localization isn't and things still need to be cleaned up.
