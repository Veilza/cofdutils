## Chronicles of Darkness Utilities
Utilities and add-ons for the [Chronicles of Darkness 2e](https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta) system.

### Developer Notes
If you'd like to follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThalissaRemnant), I retweet mostly tabletop stuff and cool art over there and will occasionally post updates about things I'm working on. Additionally I have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thalissa) if you'd like to support me!

### Contributors
Those that assist in contributing to the project will be listed here! Though I expect no help, if anyone provides any assistance I'll be more than happy to pull code in.

### Changelog
#### 1.1.0
* Added a new module: Scene Notes! This allows a storyteller to keep track of their scenes, actors within that scene, journal entries important to that scene, and general descriptions without having to fuss with their endless list of journal entries or with making full maps.
* Double clicking on the actor portrait in the Beats Menu will now open up the actor's sheet.
* All the actors in the Beats Menu will now take up the same amount of space, even if one of them has a really long name.
* Minor cleanup fixes to the Beats Menu.
* Added a description and translation lines for the Automatic Defense toggle setting.
* V9 Compatible confirmed!

#### 1.0.0
* Added the ability to give beats to individual actors from the menu
* Re-defined the "group beats menu" to just the "beats menu," since its purpose is now overview and general management.
* Since it's refined enough and in working order, I'm going to consider this the official version 1! Woo.
